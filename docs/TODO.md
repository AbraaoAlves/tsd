# TSD 0.5.x TODO

> Big list of things that should/could be done.

See also:

* Main [readme](../README.md)
* Project [scope](SCOPE.md)
* Some extra [info](INFO.md)
* More about [code](CODE.md)

## Issues

This info might later migrate to the Github Issue tracker.

## Update docs

Always text to edit in the README or ./docs.

## Local changes

Browse the code in `/src` and `/test` for `//TODO` comments,

Or use `$ grunt todos` for an overview. :point_left::+1:

Most of these are file/class/block 'local' changes: easy to fix without conflicts (hardening, re-implement etc). Some are more important then others (but which ones? :smiley_cat:)

## Tests

Never enough.

* :a:   Expand API command testing (cover more commands)
* :a:   Expand CLI tests (cover more commands)
* :m:   Add CLI test setup
* :o:	Add node.js module tests
* :id:	Consider testing JavaScript output instead of TypeScript source (with compiled declarations: so those get checked too).

Working on a way run data tests from fixtures that can be updated easily (otherwise decent coverage is insane to manage) 

* :m:	Run github api+raw caches from fixtures (with easy updates/expansion)
* :m:   Run API tests from fixtures and stored comparison output (with easy updates/expansion)
