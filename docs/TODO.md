# TSD 0.5.x TODO

> Big list of things that should/could be done.

See also:

* Main [readme](../README.md)
* Project [scope](SCOPE.md)
* Some extra [info](INFO.md)
* More about [code](CODE.md)

## Issues

This info might later migrate to the Github Issue tracker.

## Update docs

Always text to edit in the README or ./docs.

## Local changes

Browse the code in `/src` and `/test` for `//TODO` comments,

Or use `$ grunt todos` for an overview. :point_left::+1:

Most of these are file/class/block 'local' changes: easy to fix without conflicts (hardening, re-implement etc). Some are more important then others (but which ones? :smiley_cat:)

## Tests

Never enough.

* :a:   Expand API command testing (cover more commands)
* :a:   Expand CLI tests (cover more commands)
* :m:   Add CLI test setup
* :o:	Add node.js module tests
* :id:	Consider testing JavaScript output instead of TypeScript source (with compiled declarations: so those get checked too).

Working on a way run data tests from fixtures that can be updated easily (otherwise decent coverage is insane to manage) 

* :m:	Run github api+raw caches from fixtures (with easy updates/expansion)
* :m:   Run API tests from fixtures and stored comparison output (with easy updates/expansion)

## Global / multi-file changes:

Config

	* :m: Improve flexibility
	* :ab: Update tsd tests to verify changes
	* :m: Update ~~typingsPath~~ ('path' now): should be 1 length
	* :m: Update commit: should be (7-40) length (as per git convention)
	* :ng: ~~Update blob: should be optional, still fixed at 40 (as per concept commit is leading)~~ Killed: newline hell and redundant vs path+commit
* :m:	Validate config save-data before writing to diskk, catch invalid json
* :m:	Improve config validation reporting (see `tv4`, `chai-json-schema`)
* :m:	Consider renaming 'tsd-config.json' to 'tsd.json'

* :m:	Decide if API, Core etc need(more) race condition hardening (some in loaders)
* :b:	Don't keep file content/blobs in memory (load on demand + burst cache) 
* :m:	Consider if API and/or Core need to be split into command classes `/tsd/logics` (done)
* :vs:	Consider adding timeout (with option)
* :m:	Consider splitting Core.ts: index/select stuff vs helper methods/objects
* :ng:	Consider moving to class model with promise-based methods

Publishing

* :a:	Sweep and enable `tslint.json` rules we keep `./deploy/repository.json` for `v0.3.0`.
